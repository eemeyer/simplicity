A suite of Ajax search widgets to interface with the Discovery Engine.

The simplicity widgets provide a set of jQuery UI JavaScript widgets that enable a highly-responsive Ajax based search interface. They are comprised of UI widgets and a server-side search controller.

The search controller uses a RESTful API with regular URL parameters for the request and expect a JSON response.

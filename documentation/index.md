The Simplicity Widgets are an open-source suite of jQuery UI JavaScript components that enable an intuitive and highly-responsive Ajax search experience using the Discovery Engine.

The widgets interact with a server-side search controller via a RESTful API. Requests use standard query parameters, and the response is expected to be JSON.

We provide an example PHP server-side search controller.
